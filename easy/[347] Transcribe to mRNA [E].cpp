####  Transcribe to mRNA  ####

Transcribe the given DNA strand into corresponding mRNA - a type of RNA, that will be formed from DNA after transcription. DNA has the bases A, T, G and C, while RNA converts to U, A, C and G respectively.


[Examples]

___
dnaToRna("ATTAGCGCGATATACGCGTAC") ➞ "UAAUCGCGCUAUAUGCGCAUG"

dnaToRna("CGATATA") ➞ "GCUAUAU"

dnaToRna("GTCATACGACGTA") ➞ "CAGUAUGCUGCAU"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Transcription is the process of making complementary strand.
*) A, T, G and C in DNA converts to U, A, C and G respectively in mRNA.
