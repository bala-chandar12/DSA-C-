####  Solving Exponential Equations With Logarithms  ####

Create a function that takes a number a and finds the missing exponent x so that a when raised to the power of x is equal to b.


[Examples]

___
solveForExp(4, 1024) ➞ 5

solveForExp(2, 1024) ➞ 10

solveForExp(9, 3486784401) ➞ 10
_____



[Notes]
