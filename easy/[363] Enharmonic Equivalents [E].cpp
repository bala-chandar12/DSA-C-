####  Enharmonic Equivalents  ####

In music, notes can be written out in multiple ways (especially for notes on the black keys). Although these notes are spelled out differently, they still are the same note physically.

Given a musical note, create a function that returns its enharmonic equivalent. The examples below should make this clear.
