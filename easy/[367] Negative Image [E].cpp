####  Negative Image  ####

Suppose an image can be represented as a 2D array of 0s and 1s. Write a function to reverse an image. Replace the 0s with 1s and vice versa.


[Examples]

___
reverseImage([
  [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 1]
]) ➞ [
  [0, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 0]
]

reverseImage([
  [1, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 0]
]) ➞ [
  [0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1]
]

reverseImage([
  [1, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0]
]) ➞ [
  [0, 1, 1],
  [0, 1, 1]
]
