####  Sine, Cosine and Tangent  ####

Create three functions that will do three things:
___
*) Multiply one number by the sine of another number.
*) Multiply one number by the COSINE of another number.
*) Multiply one number by the tangent of another number.
___

In each function, you will be given 2 numbers: x and y. Another important thing to note, the numbers will be in degrees, not radians. That is extremely important. Remember to round the result to 2 decimal places, as well.


[Examples]

___
sine(8, 27) ➞ 8 sin 27 ➞ 3.63

cosine(10, 4) ➞ 10 cos 4 ➞ 9.98

tangent(4, 39) ➞ 4 tan 39 ➞ 3.24

Degrees to Radians

In geometry, both degree and radian represent the measure of an angle. One complete anticlockwise revolution can be represented by 2π (in radians) or 360° (in degrees).

Returns the integral value that is nearest to the argument, with halfway cases rounded away from zero.
