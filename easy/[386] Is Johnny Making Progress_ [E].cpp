####  Is Johnny Making Progress?  ####

To train for an upcoming marathon, Johnny goes on one long-distance run each Saturday. He wants to track how often the number of miles he runs this Saturday exceeds the number of miles run the previous Saturday. This is called a progress day.
Create a function that takes in an array of miles run every Saturday and returns Johnny's total number of progress days.


[Examples]

___
progressDays([3, 4, 1, 2]) ➞ 2
// There are two progress days, (3->4) and (1->2)

progressDays([10, 11, 12, 9, 10]) ➞ 3

progressDays([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 9]) ➞ 1

progressDays([9, 9])  ➞ 0
_____



[Notes]

Running the same number of miles as last week does not count as a progress day.
