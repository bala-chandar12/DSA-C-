####  Finish the Sentence You're On!  ####

POV: You are in an exam and time has just run out. While the teacher's back is turned, you hastily take the opportunity to finish scribbling down the last few words of the conclusion.
For this challenge, it takes 0.5 seconds to write a character (not including spaces). Given the full sentence and the unfinished sentence as inputs, return the time it takes to finish writing in seconds.


[Worked Example]

___
timeToFinish(
  "And so brings my conclusion to its conclusion.",
  "And so brings my conclusion to"
) ➞ 7

// "its" has 3 characters
// "conclusion." has 11 characters, including punctuation.
// 11 + 3 = 14
// 14 x 0.5 = 7
// Remember not to include spaces.
