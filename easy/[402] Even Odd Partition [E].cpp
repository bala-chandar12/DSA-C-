####  Even Odd Partition  ####

Write a function that partitions the array into two subarrays: one with all even integers, and the other with all odd integers. Return your result in the following format:
___
[[evens], [odds]]
_____



[Examples]

___
evenOddPartition([5, 8, 9, 2, 0]) ➞ [[8, 2, 0], [5, 9]]

evenOddPartition([1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]) ➞ [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]

evenOddPartition([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) ➞ [[], [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]]

evenOddPartition([]) ➞ [[], []]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Return two empty subarrays if the input is an empty array.
*) Keep the same relative ordering as the original array.

Integers which are perfectly divisible by 2 are called even numbers. And those integers which are not perfectly divisible by 2 are not known as odd number.
