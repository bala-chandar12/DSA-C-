####  From A to Z  ####

Given a string indicating a range of letters, return a string which includes all the letters in that range, including the last letter. Note that if the range is given in capital letters, return the string in capitals also!

gimmeTheLetters("a-z") ➞ "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

gimmeTheLetters("h-o") ➞ "hijklmno"

*) A hyphen will separate the two letters in the string.
