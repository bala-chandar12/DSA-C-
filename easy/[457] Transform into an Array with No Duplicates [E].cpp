####  Transform into an Array with No Duplicates  ####

A set is a collection of unique items. A set can be formed from an array by removing all duplicate items.
___
[1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5]
// original array

[1, 3, 5]
// original array transformed into a set
_____

Create a function that sorts an array and removes all duplicate items from it.


[Examples]

___
set([1, 3, 3, 5, 5]) ➞ [1, 3, 5]

set([4, 4, 4, 4]) ➞ [4]

set([5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]) ➞ [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]

set([3, 3, 3, 2, 1]) ➞ [1, 2, 3]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) All arrays will have at least one element.
*) For this question, output an array, not a set.
