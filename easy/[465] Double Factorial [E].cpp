####  Double Factorial  ####

Create a function that takes a number num and returns its double factorial. Mathematically, the formulas for double factorial are as follows.
If num is even:
___
num !! = num (num - 2)( num - 4)(num - 6) ... (4)(2)
_____

If num is odd:
___
num !! = num (num - 2)(num - 4)(num - 6) ... (3)(1)
_____

If num = 0 or num = -1, then num !! = 1 by convention.


[Examples]

___
doubleFactorial(0) ➞ 1

doubleFactorial(2) ➞ 2

doubleFactorial(9) ➞ 945
# 9*7*5*3*1 = 945

doubleFactorial(14) ➞ 645120
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Assume all input values are greater than or equal to -1.
*) Try to solve it with recursion.
*) Double factorial is not the same as factorial * 2.
