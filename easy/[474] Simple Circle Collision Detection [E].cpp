####  Simple Circle Collision Detection  ####

Create a function that returns true if the given circles are intersecting, otherwise return false. The circles are given as two arrays containing the values in the following order:



[Examples]

___
isCircleCollision([10, 0, 0], [10, 10, 10]) ➞ true

isCircleCollision([1, 0, 0], [1, 10, 10]) ➞ false
_____



[Notes]

___
*) You can expect useable input and positive radii.
*) The given coordinates are the centers of the circles.
*) We are looking for intersecting areas, not intersection outlines.
*) Check the Resources tab for help.
