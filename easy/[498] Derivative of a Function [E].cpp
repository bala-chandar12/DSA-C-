####  Derivative of a Function  ####

Create a function that takes numbers b and m as arguments and returns the derivative of the function f(x)=x^b with respect to x at the point where x=m, where b and m are constants.


[Examples]

___
derivative(1, 4) ➞ 1

derivative(3, -2) ➞ 12

derivative(4, -3) ➞ -108
_____



[Notes]

___
