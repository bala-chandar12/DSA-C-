####  Distance between Point and a Line  ####

Given the formula for a straight line y = ax + b and the x, y coordinates of a point, find the distance between that point and the line. Round the result to two decimal points.


[Examples]

___
dist("y=(-3/4)x-5/4", 5, 2) ➞ 5.6

dist("y=(5+1/3)x-2.3", 1, 4) ➞ 0.18

dist("y=2.2x-(3+1/5)", 3, -2) ➞ 2.23
