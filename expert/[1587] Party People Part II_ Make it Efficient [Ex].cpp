####  Party People Part II: Make it Efficient  ####

Ava, Mark, Sheila, and Pete are at a party. However, Ava and Sheila are only staying if there are at least 4 people, Pete is only staying if there's 1 person, and Mark is only staying if there are at least 5 people. Therefore, Mark leaves, which makes Ava and Sheila leave, and Pete is left alone.
Given an array with the preferences of every person at a party for the minimum number of people present, determine how many people will stay.

party_people([10, 12, 15, 15, 5]) ➞ 0

party_people([2, 1, 2, 0]) ➞ 4
