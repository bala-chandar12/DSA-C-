/*
####  Calculate How Many Numbers with Unique Digits  ####

The function is given an integer n. Count the numbers with unique digits in the range 0 <= num < pow(10, n).


[Examples]

___
numsWithUniqueDigits(2) ➞ 91
// There are 100 numbers in total (from 0 to 99 inclusive).
// The following 9 numbers should not be counted:
// 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99
// Thus 100 – 9 ➞ 91
