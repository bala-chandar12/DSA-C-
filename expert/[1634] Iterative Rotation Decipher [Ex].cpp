####  Iterative Rotation Decipher  ####

In this challenge, you have to perform reverse steps of Iterative Rotation Cipher. Decoding is done by performing a series of character and substring rotations on a string input.
Create a function that takes a string of encoded message eMessage and returns a decoded message.
___
Encoded Message = `10 hu fmo a,ys vi utie mr snehn rni tvte .ysushou teI fwea pmapi apfrok rei tnocsclet`

Decoded Message = `If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.`
