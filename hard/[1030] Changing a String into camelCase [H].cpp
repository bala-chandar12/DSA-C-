####  Changing a String into camelCase  ####

Using Camel Case (or camelCase) is where the first word is in lower case, and all words after it have their first letter capitalised. Note that there are no spaces in between words!
Create a function that takes a string and returns it back in camelCase.


[Examples]

___
camelCasing("Hello World") ➞ "helloWorld"

camelCasing("snake_case") ➞ "snakeCase"

camelCasing("low high_HIGH") ➞ "lowHighHigh"
