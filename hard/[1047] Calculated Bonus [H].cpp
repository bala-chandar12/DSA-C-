####  Calculated Bonus  ####

A financial institution provides professional services to banks and claims charges from the customers based on the number of man-days provided. Internally, it has set a scheme to motivate and reward staff to meet and exceed targeted billable utilization and revenues by paying a bonus for each day claimed from customers in excess of a threshold target.
This quarterly scheme is calculated with a threshold target of 32 days per quarter, and the incentive payment for each billable day in excess of such threshold target is shown as follows:

Please note that incentive payment is calculated progressively. As an example, if an employee reached total billable days of 45 in a quarter, his/her incentive payment is computed as follows:
___
32*0 + 8*325 + 5*550 = 5350
_____

Write a function to read the billable days of an employee and return the bonus he/she has obtained in that quarter.
