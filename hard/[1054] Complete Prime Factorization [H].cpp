####  Complete Prime Factorization  ####

Create a function that decomposes an integer into its prime factors, ordered from smallest to largest.
For instance:
___
completeFactorization(24) = [2, 2, 2, 3]
// Since 24 = 8 x 3 = 2^3 x 3 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
_____



[Examples]

___
completeFactorization(10) ➞ [2, 5]

completeFactorization(9) ➞ [3, 3]

completeFactorization(72) ➞ [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
_____



[Notes]

1 is not considered a prime number, so omit it in your final array of prime factors.
