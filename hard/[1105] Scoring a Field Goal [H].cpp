####  Scoring a Field Goal  ####

In (American) Football, a team can score if they manage to kick a ball through the goal (i.e. above the crossbar and between the uprights).
Create a function that returns true if the ball 0 goes through the goal. You will be given an array of strings.

isGoalScored([
  "  #     #  ",

  "     #     ",
  "     #     "
]) ➞ true

isGoalScored([
  "  #0    #  ",
  "  #     #  ",
