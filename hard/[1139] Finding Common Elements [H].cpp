####  Finding Common Elements  ####

Create a function that takes two "sorted" arrays of numbers and returns an array of numbers which are common to both the input arrays.


[Examples]

___
commonElements([-1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9], [1, 3]) ➞ [3]

commonElements([1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9], [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10]) ➞ [1, 3, 4, 7]

commonElements([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 2, 4, 5]) ➞ [1, 2, 4, 5]

commonElements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [10, 12, 13, 15]) ➞ []
