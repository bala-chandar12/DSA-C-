####  Array Chunking  ####

Given an array and chunk size "n", create a function such that it divides the array into many subarrays where each subarray is of length size "n".


[Examples]

___
chunk([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) ➞ [
  [1, 2], [3, 4]
]

chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 3) ➞ [
  [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7]
]

chunk([1, 2, 3, 4 ,5], 10) ➞ [
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
]
_____



[Notes]

Remember that number of subarrays may not be equal to chunk size.
