####  Sum of Missing Numbers  ####

Create a function that returns the sum of missing numbers from the given array.


[Examples]

___
sumMissingNumbers([4, 3, 8, 1, 2]) ➞ 18
// 5 + 6 + 7 = 18

sumMissingNumbers([17, 16, 15, 10, 11, 12]) ➞ 27
// 13 + 14 = 27

sumMissingNumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ 0
// No Missing Numbers (i.e. all numbers in [1, 5] are present in the list)
_____



[Notes]

The numerical range to consider when searching for the missing numbers in the array is the sequence of consecutive numbers between the minimum and maximum of the numbers (inclusive).
