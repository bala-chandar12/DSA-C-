####  Through the Grid  ####

How many ways are there to navigate through a grid (w * h)?

Suppose you're on a 4 × 6 grid, and want to go from the bottom left to the top right. How many different paths can you take? Avoid backtracking, you can only move right or up.
Create a function that takes width and height and returns the amount of possibilities.


[Examples]

___
gridPos(1, 1) ➞ 2

gridPos(6, 4) ➞ 210

gridPos(5, 5) ➞ 252
_____
