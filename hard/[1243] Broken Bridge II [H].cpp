Create a function that returns the count of all bridges in a two-dimensional grid.
Bridge B should be counted if:

[Example]

___
"#########/#       #/#   #   #/#   #   #/#### ####/#   #   #/#   #   #/#       #/#########"

In this case the number 4 is returned because, when unraveled, the string reveals four bridges that meet the requirements listed above as shown:
___
#########/
#       #/
#   #   #/
#   #   #/
#### ####/
#   #   #/
#   #   #/
#       #/
#########
