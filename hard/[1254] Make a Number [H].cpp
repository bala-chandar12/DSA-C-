####  Make a Number  ####

In this challenge, you have to find all the subsequences of consecutive numbers that, when their numbers are added between them, are equals to the given number.
Given a positive integer n, implement a function that returns a matrix containing every sequence of consecutive numbers smaller than n, sorted ascendingly by their first term, whose sum is equal to n.


[Examples]

___
makeNumber(9) ➞ [ [2, 3, 4], [4, 5] ]

makeNumber(8) ➞ [[]]

makeNumber(100) ➞ [ [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] ]
_____



[Notes]

If no sequence sum is equal to the given n, return an empty array (see example #2).
