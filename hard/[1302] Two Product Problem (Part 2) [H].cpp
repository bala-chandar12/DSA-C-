####  Two Product Problem (Part 2)  ####

Create a function that takes an array arr and a number n and returns an array of two integers whose product is that of the number n.


[Examples]

___
twoProduct([1, 2, 3, 4, 13, 5], 39) ➞ [3, 13]

twoProduct([11, 2, 7, 3, 5, 0], 55) ➞ [5, 11]

twoProduct([100, 12, 4, 1, 2], 15) ➞ [0, 0]
//Numbers not found in given array.
_____



[Notes]

___
*) No duplicates.
