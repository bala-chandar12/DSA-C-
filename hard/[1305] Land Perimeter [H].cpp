####  Land Perimeter  ####

The function is given a map with 1 representing land, 0 representing water. A land cell can have four neighbors along its edges. Compute the total perimeter of shore-lines that are defined by land cells touching water or the outer edges of the map. Each cell edge has a length equal to 1. An isolated cell without neighbors has a total perimeter length of 4.
