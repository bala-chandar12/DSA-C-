/*
####  Number of Two or More Consecutive Ones  ####

Create a function that counts the number of blocks of two or more adjacent 1s in an array.


[Examples]

___
countOnes([1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]) ➞ 2
// Two instances: [1, 1] (middle) and [1, 1, 1] (end)

countOnes([1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]) ➞ 0

countOnes([1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]) ➞ 1

countOnes([0, 0, 0]) ➞ 0
_____



[Notes]

___
*) A single 1 by itself (surrounded by a zero on its left and right), does not count towards the total (see first example).
*) Each input will contain only zeroes and ones.
