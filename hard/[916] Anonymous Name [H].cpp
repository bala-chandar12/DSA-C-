/*
####  Anonymous Name  ####

You are in the process of creating a chat application and want to add an anonymous name feature. This anonymous name feature will create an alias that consists of two capitalized words beginning with the same letter as the users first name.
Create a function that determines if the array of users is mapped to an array of anonymous names correctly.


[Examples]

___
isCorrectAliases(["Adrian M.", "Harriet S.", "Mandy T."], ["Amazing Artichoke", "Hopeful Hedgehog", "Marvelous Mouse"]) ➞ true

isCorrectAliases(["Rachel F.", "Pam G.", "Fred Z.", "Nancy K."], ["Reassuring Rat", "Peaceful Panda", "Fantastic Frog", "Notable Nickel"]) ➞ true

isCorrectAliases(["Beth T."], ["Brandishing Mimosa"]) ➞ false
// Both words in "Brandishing Mimosa" should begin with a "B" - "Brandishing Beaver" would do the trick.
_____



[Notes]

Both words in the alias should be capitalized.
