####  Pronouncing the Xs  ####

Create a function which replaces all the x's in the string in the following ways:
Replace all x's with "cks" UNLESS:
___
*) The word begins with "x", therefore replace it with "z".
*) The word is just the letter "x", therefore replace it with "ecks".
___



[Examples]

___
xPronounce("Inside the box was a xylophone") ➞ "Inside the bocks was a zylophone"

xPronounce("The x ray is excellent") ➞ "The ecks ray is eckscellent"

xPronounce("OMG x box unboxing video x D") ➞ "OMG ecks bocks unbocksing video ecks D"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) All x's are lowercase.
*) I know that not all words with x's follow this rule, but there are too many edge cases to count!
