####  Mini Peaks  ####

Write a function that returns all the elements in an array that are strictly greater than their adjacent left and right neighbors.


[Examples]

___
miniPeaks([4, 5, 2, 1, 4, 9, 7, 2]) ➞ [5, 9]
// 5 has neighbours 4 and 2, both are less than 5.

miniPeaks([1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 4]) ➞ [2, 3, 5]

miniPeaks([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) ➞ []
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Do not count boundary numbers, since they only have one left/right neighbor.
*) If no such numbers exist, return an empty array.

The simplest solution is to count the total number of elements in the vector having the specified value. If the count is nonzero, we have found our element. This can be …
