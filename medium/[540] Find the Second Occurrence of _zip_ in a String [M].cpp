####  Find the Second Occurrence of "zip" in a String  ####

Write a function that returns the position of the second occurrence of "zip" in a string, or -1 if it does not occur at least twice. Your code should be general enough to pass every possible case where "zip" can occur in a string.


[Examples]

___
findZip("all zip files are zipped") ➞ 18

findZip("all zip files are compressed") ➞ -1
_____



[Notes]

Uppercase "Zip" is not the same as lowercase "zip".
