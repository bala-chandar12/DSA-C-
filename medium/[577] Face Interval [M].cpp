####  Face Interval  ####

In mathematics, interval is the difference between the largest number and the smallest number in an array.
To illustrate:
___
A = (3, 5, 7, 23, 11, 42, 80)

Interval of A = 80 - 3 = 77
_____

Create a function that takes an array and returns ":)" if the interval of the array is equal to any other element; otherwise return ":(".


[Examples]

___
faceInterval([1, 2, 5, 8, 3, 9]) ➞ ":)"
// Array interval is equal to one of the other elements.

faceInterval([5, 2, 8, 3, 11]) ➞ ":("
// Array interval is not among the other elements.

*) Arrays won't contain any duplicate numbers.
