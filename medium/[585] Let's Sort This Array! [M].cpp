####  Let's Sort This Array!  ####

Create a function that takes an array of numbers arr, a string s and return an array of numbers as per the following rules:

*) "None" returns an array without any modification.
___



[Examples]

___
AscDesNone([4, 3, 2, 1], "Asc" ) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4]

AscDesNone([7, 8, 11, 66], "Des") ➞ [66, 11, 8, 7]

AscDesNone([1, 2, 3, 4], "None") ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4]
