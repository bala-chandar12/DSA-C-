####  Sum Fractions  ####

Create a function that takes a vector of vectors as an argument. Each inner vector has 2 elements. The first element is the numerator and the second element is the denominator. Return the sum of the fractions rounded to the nearest whole number.


[Examples]

___
sum_fractions({{18, 13}, {4, 5}}) ➞ 2

sum_fractions({{36, 4}, {22, 60}}) ➞ 9

sum_fractions({{11, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 4}, {21, 11}, {12, 6}}) ➞ 11
_____



[Notes]

Your result should be a number not string.
