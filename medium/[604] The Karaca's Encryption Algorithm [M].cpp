####  The Karaca's Encryption Algorithm  ####

Make a function that encrypts a given input with these steps:
Input: "apple"
Step 1: Reverse the input: "elppa"
Step 2: Replace all vowels using the following chart:
___
a => 0
e => 1
i => 2
o => 2
u => 3

// "1lpp0"
_____

Step 3: Add "aca" to the end of the word: "1lpp0aca"
Output: "1lpp0aca"


[Examples]

___
encrypt("banana") ➞ "0n0n0baca"

encrypt("karaca") ➞ "0c0r0kaca"

encrypt("burak") ➞ "k0r3baca"

encrypt("alpaca") ➞ "0c0pl0aca"
_____



[Notes]

All inputs are strings, no uppercases and all output must be strings.
