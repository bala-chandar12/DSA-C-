####  Recursion: Array Sum  ####

Write a function that finds the sum of an array. Make your function recursive.


[Examples]

___
sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ 10

sum([1, 2]) ➞ 3

sum([1]) ➞ 1

sum([]) ➞ 0
_____

Recursion With a Vector
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19803751/c-recursion-with-a-vector
In the method int listar(int v[5],int l){ you are not using the parameter l at all. Shouldn't the code be using that instead of making n=0 in each recursive call.

Calculating the Sum of a Vector of Numbers

We will begin our investigation with a simple problem that you already know how to solve without using recursion. Suppose that you want to calculate the sum of a vector …
_________
_________
vector::empty

Returns whether the vector is empty (i.e. whether its size is 0).

_________
std::vector::pop_back
https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/pop_back/
Removes the last element in the vector, effectively reducing the container size by one.
