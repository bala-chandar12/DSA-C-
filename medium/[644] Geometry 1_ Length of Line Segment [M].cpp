####  Geometry 1: Length of Line Segment  ####

Write a function that takes coordinates of two points on a two-dimensional plane and returns the length of the line segment connecting those two points.


[Examples]

___
lineLength([15, 7], [22, 11]) ➞ 8.06

lineLength([0, 0], [0, 0]) ➞ 0

lineLength([0, 0], [1, 1]) ➞ 1.41
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The order of the given numbers is X, Y.
