####  Word Builder  ####

In this challenge, you have to build a word from the scrambled letters contained in the first given array. For establishing how to assign the spots to the letters, you will use the positions contained in the second given array.
___
letters = ["e", "t", "s", "t"]
positions = [1, 3, 2, 0]

Step 1 ➞ Letter "e" goes to index 1 ➞ _  e  _   _
Step 2 ➞ Letter "t" goes to index 3 ➞ _  e  _   t
Step 3 ➞ Letter "s" goes to index 2 ➞ _  e  s   t
Step 4 ➞ Letter "t" goes to index 0 ➞ t  e  s   t
_____

Given the two arrays letters (containing the scrambled letters of the word) and positions (containing the indexes of the letters), implement a function that returns the resulting word as a string.


[Examples]

___
wordBuilder(["e", "t", "s", "t"], [1, 3, 2, 0]) ➞ "test"

wordBuilder(["b", "e", "t", "i", "d", "a"], [3, 0, 5, 4, 1, 2]) ➞ "edabit"

wordBuilder(["g", "e", "o"], [1, 0, 2]) ➞ "ego"
_____



[Notes]

Every given test case has valid parameters, don't worry about exceptions handling.
