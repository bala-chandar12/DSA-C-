####  Fractions and Rounding  ####

Given a fraction frac (given in the format "1/2" for example) and n number of decimal places, return a sentence in the following format:
"{fraction} rounded to {n} decimal places is {answer}"


[Examples]

___
fracRound("1/3", 5) ➞ "1/3 rounded to 5 decimal places is 0.33333"

fracRound("2/8", 4) ➞ "2/8 rounded to 4 decimal places is 0.2500"

fracRound("22/7", 2) ➞ "22/7 rounded to 2 decimal places is 3.14"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Add trailing zeros if n is greater than the actual number of decimal places the fraction has (see example #2).
*) Numbers greater than one may be given as top-heavy fractions (no mixed numbers).
*) n won't be 1 because that would cause "decimal places" to be "decimal place", making the challenge more cumbersome than it needs to be.
