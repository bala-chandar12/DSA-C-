####  Order by Length First  ####

Graded lexicographic order (grlex order for short) is a way of ordering words that:

For example, in grlex order:
___
*) "tray" < "trapped" since "tray" has length 4 while "trapped" has length 7.
*) "trap" < "tray" since both have length 4, but "trap" comes before "tray" in the dictionary.
___

Given an array of words, return that array in grlex order.


[Examples]

___
makeGrlex(["small", "big"]) ➞ ["big", "small"]

makeGrlex(["cat", "ran", "for", "the", "rat"]) ➞ ["cat", "for", "ran", "rat", "the"]

makeGrlex(["this", "is", "a", "small", "test"]) ➞ ["a", "is", "test", "this", "small"]
