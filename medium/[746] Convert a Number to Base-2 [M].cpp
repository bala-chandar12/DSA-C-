####  Convert a Number to Base-2  ####

Create a function that returns a base-2 (binary) representation of a base-10 (decimal) string number. To convert is simple: ((2) means base-2 and (10) means base-10) 010101001(2) = 1 + 8 + 32 + 128.
Going from right to left, the value of the most right bit is 1, now from that every bit to the left will be x2 the value, value of an 8 bit binary numbers are (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1).


[Examples]

___
binary(1) ➞ "1"
// 1*1 = 1

binary(5) ➞ "101"
// 1*1 + 1*4 = 5

binary(10) ➞ "1010"
// 1*2 + 1*8 = 10

[Notes]

___
*) Numbers will always be below 1024 (not including 1024).
*) The && operator could be useful.
*) The strings will always go to the length at which the most left bit's value gets bigger than the number in decimal.
*) If a binary conversion for 0 is attempted, return "0".
