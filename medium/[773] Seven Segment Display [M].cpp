####  Seven Segment Display  ####

Create a function that takes a single Hexadecimal number as an argument and returns the equivalent six-digit binary number to light the display. Consider the six-digit binary number as an incoming input from a serial port. The segment display is a common cathode segment display that means you need to give a logical 1 to light up each segment.



[Examples]

___
toDisplay('1') ➞ 0x06

toDisplay('8') ➞ 0x7F

toDisplay('0') ➞ 0x3F
_____
