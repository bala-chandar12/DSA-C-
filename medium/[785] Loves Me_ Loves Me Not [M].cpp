####  Loves Me, Loves Me Not...  ####

"Loves me, loves me not" is a traditional game in which a person plucks off all the petals of a flower one by one, saying the phrase "Loves me" and "Loves me not" when determining whether the one that they love, loves them back.
Given a number of petals, return a string which repeats the phrases "Loves me" and "Loves me not" for every alternating petal, and return the last phrase in all caps. Remember to put a comma and space between phrases.
