####  Sock Pairs  ####

Joseph is in the middle of packing for a vacation. He's having a bit of trouble finding all of his socks, though.
Write a function that returns the number of sock pairs he has. A sock pair consists of two of the same letter, such as "AA". The socks are represented as an unordered sequence.


[Examples]

___
sockPairs("AA") ➞ 1

sockPairs("ABABC") ➞ 2

sockPairs("CABBACCC") ➞ 4
_____



[Notes]

___
*) If given an empty string (no socks in the drawer), return 0.
*) There can be multiple pairs of the same type of sock, such as two pairs of CC for the last example.

When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop.
