####  Product of Remaining Elements  ####

Write a function that returns true if you can partition an array into one element and the rest, such that this element is equal to the product of all other elements excluding itself.


[Examples]

___
canPartition([2, 8, 4, 1]) ➞ true
// 8 = 2 x 4 x 1

canPartition([-1, -10, 1, -2, 20]) ➞ false

canPartition([-1, -20, 5, -1, -2, 2]) ➞ true
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The array may contain duplicates.
*) Multiple solutions can exist, any solution is sufficient to return true.
