####  Check if One Array is a Subset of Another  ####

Array A is contained inside array B if each element in A also exists in B.
The number of times a number is present doesn't matter. In other words, if we transformed both arrays into sets, A would be a subset of B.
___
A = [3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 5]
B = [1, 3, 9, 5, 8, 44, 44]

A_Set = [3, 9, 5]
B_Set = [1, 3, 9, 5, 8, 44]

// A_Set is a subset of B_Set
_____

Create a function that determines if the first array is a subset of the second.


[Examples]

___
subset([1, 3], [1, 3, 3, 5]) ➞ true

subset([4, 8, 7], [7, 4, 4, 4, 9, 8]) ➞ true

subset([1, 3], [1, 33]) ➞ false

subset([1, 3, 10], [10, 8, 8, 8]) ➞ false
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Each input array will have at least one element.
*) Check the resources tab for a hint.
