####  Sort by Frequency  ####

Create a function that takes an array of integers n and sort the elements of the array by decreasing frequency of the elements. If two elements have the same frequency, sort them by increasing value.


[Examples]

___
sortFreq([2, 3, 5, 3, 7, 9, 5, 3, 7]) ➞ [3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 2, 9]

sortFreq([1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 0, 1, 6, 8, 8, 6, 9, 1]) ➞ [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 6, 8, 8, 2, 3, 5, 9]

sortFreq([4, 4, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 8]) ➞ [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 8]
_____



[Notes]

All input numbers will be between 0-9.
