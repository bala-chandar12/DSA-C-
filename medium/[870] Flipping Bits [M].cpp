####  Flipping Bits  ####

You will be given a list of 32-bit unsigned integers. Flip all the bits 1 -> 0 and 0 -> 1 and return the result as an unsigned integer.


[Worked Example]

___
n = 4
4 is 0100 in binary. We are working in 32 bits so:
00000000000000000000000000000100 = 4
11111111111111111111111111111011 = 4294967291
return 4294967291
_____



[Examples]

___
flippingBits(2147483647) ➞ 2147483648

flippingBits(1) ➞ 4294967294

flippingBits(4) ➞ 4294967291
