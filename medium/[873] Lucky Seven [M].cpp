####  Lucky Seven  ####

Given an array of numbers, return whether it is possible to make the number 7 by adding any three different numbers together.


[Examples]

___
luckySeven([2, 4, 3, 8, 9, 1]) ➞ true

luckySeven([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) ➞ true

luckySeven([0, 0, 0, 2, 3]) ➞ false
// You cannot repeat the same number to make 2 + 2 + 3 = 7

luckySeven([4, 3]) ➞ false
// You need three different numbers.

For Loop

When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop.

While Loop

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached. Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.
