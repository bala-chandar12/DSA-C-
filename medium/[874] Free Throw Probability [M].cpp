####  Free Throw Probability  ####

What's the probability of someone making a certain amount of free throws in a row given their free throw success percentage? If Sally makes 50% of her free shot throws, then Sally's probability of making 5 in a row would be 3%.


[Examples]

___
freeThrows("75%", 5) ➞ "24%"

freeThrows("25%", 3) ➞ "2%"

freeThrows("90%", 30) ➞ "4%"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The success rate is a string.
*) The function should return a string with the percent sign.
*) Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
