####  Fix the Broken Code  ####

A student learning C++ was trying to make a function that sorts all the letters of a word, but their code is broken, and they can't figure out why.
Spot and fix the error(s) in the code to make the function work.


[Examples]

___
sortWord("dcba") ➞ "abcd"

sortWord("Unpredictable") ➞ "Uabcdeeilnprt"

sortWord("pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis") ➞ "aacccccceiiiiiilllmmnnnnooooooooopprrsssstuuv"
_____



[Notes]

Input is a word.
