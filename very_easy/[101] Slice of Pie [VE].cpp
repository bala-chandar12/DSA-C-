####  Slice of Pie  ####

Create a function that determines whether or not it's possible to split a pie fairly given these three parameters:

The function will be in this form:
___
equalSlices(total slices, no. recipients, slices each)
_____



[Examples]

___
equalSlices(11, 5, 2) ➞ true
// 5 people x 2 slices each = 10 slices < 11 slices

equalSlices(11, 5, 3) ➞ false
// 5 people x 3 slices each = 15 slices > 11 slices

equalSlices(8, 3, 2) ➞ true

equalSlices(8, 3, 3) ➞ false

equalSlices(24, 12, 2) ➞ true
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Return (trivially) true if there are zero people.
*) It's fine not to use the entire pie.
*) All test parameters are integers.
*) Don't forget to return the result.
*) If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab.
*) If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab.
