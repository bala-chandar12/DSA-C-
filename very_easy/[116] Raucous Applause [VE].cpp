####  Raucous Applause  ####

After an amazing performance, the crowd goes wild! People clap enthusiastically and most claps overlap with each other to create one homogeneous sound.
An overlapped clap is a clap which starts but doesn't finish, as in "ClaClap" (The first clap is cut short and there are overall 2 claps)
Given a string of what the overlapping claps sounded like, return how many claps were made in total.


[Examples]

___
countClaps("ClaClaClaClap!") ➞ 4

countClaps("ClClClaClaClaClap!") ➞ 6

countClaps("CCClaClClap!Clap!ClClClap!") ➞ 9
_____



[Notes]

Each clap starts with a capital "C".
