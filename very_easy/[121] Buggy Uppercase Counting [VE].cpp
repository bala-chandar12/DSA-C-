####  Buggy Uppercase Counting  ####

In the Code tab is a function which is meant to return how many uppercase letters there are in a list of various words. Fix the list comprehension so that the code functions normally!


[Examples]

___
countUppercase(["SOLO", "hello", "Tea", "wHat"]) ➞ 6

countUppercase(["little", "lower", "down"]) ➞ 0

counUppercase(["EDAbit", "Educate", "Coding"]) ➞ 5
