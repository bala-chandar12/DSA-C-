####  Bitwise Operations  ####

A decimal number can be represented as a sequence of bits. To illustrate:
___
6 = 00000110
23 = 00010111
_____

From the bitwise representation of numbers, we can calculate the bitwise AND, bitwise OR and bitwise XOR. Using the example above:
___
bitwiseAND(6, 23) ➞ 00000110

bitwiseOR(6, 23) ➞ 00010111

bitwiseXOR(6, 23) ➞ 00010001
_____

Write three functions to calculate the bitwise AND, bitwise OR and bitwise XOR of two numbers.


[Examples]

___
bitwiseAND(7, 12) ➞ 4

bitwiseOR(7, 12) ➞ 15

bitwiseXOR(7, 12) ➞ 11
_____
