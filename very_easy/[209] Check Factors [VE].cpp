####  Check Factors  ####

Write a function that returns true if all integers in an array are factors of a number, and false otherwise.


[Examples]

___
checkFactors([2, 3, 4], 12) ➞ true
// Since 2, 3, and 4 are all factors of 12.

checkFactors([1, 2, 3, 8], 12) ➞ false
// 8 is not a factor of 12.

checkFactors([1, 2, 50], 100) ➞ true

checkFactors([3, 6], 9) ➞ false
