####  Reverse the Number  ####

Create a function that takes an integer n and reverses it.


[Examples]

___
rev(5121) ➞ "1215"

rev(69) ➞ "96"

rev(-122157) ➞ "751221"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) This challenge is about using two operators that are related to division.
*) The result is just a string, so you don't need to use pow(double a, double b) or other trickery for the output.
*) If the number is negative, treat it like it's positive.
