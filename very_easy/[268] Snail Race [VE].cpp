####  Snail Race  ####

Steve and Maurice have racing snails. They each have three, a slow s, medium m and fast f one. Although Steve's snails are all a bit stronger than Maurice's, Maurice has a trick up his sleeve. His plan is:

Create a function that determines whether Maurice's plan will work by outputting true if Maurice wins 2/3 games.
The function inputs:



[Examples]

___
mauriceWins([3, 5, 10], [4, 7, 11]) ➞ true
// Since the matches are (3, 11), (5, 4) and (10, 7), Maurice wins 2 out of 3.

mauriceWins([6, 8, 9], [7, 12, 14]) ➞ false
// Since the matches are (6, 14), (8, 7) and (9, 12), Steve wins 2 out of 3.

mauriceWins([1, 8, 20], [2, 9, 100]) ➞ true
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Maurice wins if his competing snail's speed strictly exceeds Steve's snail's speed.
*) Steve will always play in this order: [f, s, m].
*) The order you'll get the snails is always in ascending order.
