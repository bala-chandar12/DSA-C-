####  Doubleton Number  ####

Mubashir was reading about Doubleton Numbers on Wikipedia.
A natural number is a "Doubleton Number", if it contains exactly two distinct digits. For example, 23, 35, 100, 12121 are doubleton numbers, and 123 and 114455 are not.
Create a function which takes a number n and finds the next doubleton number.


[Examples]

___
doubleton(10) ➞ 12
// 12 has only two distinct numbers 1 and 2

doubleton(120) ➞ 121
// 121 has only two distinct numbers 1 and 2

doubleton(1234) ➞ 1311
// 1311 has only two distinct numbers 1 and 3
