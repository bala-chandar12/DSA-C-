####  Maximum Edge of a Triangle  ####

Create a function that finds the maximum range of a triangle's third edge, where the side lengths are all integers.


[Examples]

___
nextEdge(8, 10) ➞ 17

nextEdge(5, 7) ➞ 11

nextEdge(9, 2) ➞ 10
_____



[Notes]

___
*) (side1 + side2) - 1 = maximum range of third edge.
*) The side lengths of the triangle are positive integers.
*) Don't forget to return the result.
