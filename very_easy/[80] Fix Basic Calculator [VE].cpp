####  Fix Basic Calculator  ####

Mubashir created a function that takes two numbers a and b and an operator o. His function should return the result of the corresponding mathematical function on both numbers. If the operator is not one of the specified characters +, -, /, *, or if there is a division by zero, the function should return -1. Help him by fixing the code in the code tab to pass this challenge.
Look at the examples below to get an idea of what the function should do:


[Examples]

___
basicCalculator(2, '+',  4) ➞ 6

basicCalculator(6, '-', 5) ➞ 1

basicCalculator(12, '/', 3) ➞ 4

basicCalculator(3, '*', 4) ➞ 12

basicCalculator(1, '/', 0) ➞ -1
// Division by zero is not possible

basicCalculator(1, 'x', 0) ➞ -1
// 'x' is not an operator
