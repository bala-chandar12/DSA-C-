####  Limit a Number's Value  ####

Create a function that takes three number arguments — one number as an input and two additional numbers representing the endpoints of a closed range — and return the number limited to this range.
___
*) If the number falls within the range, the number should be returned.
*) If the number is less than the lower limit of the range, the lower limit should be returned.
*) If the number is greater than the upper limit of the range, the upper limit should be returned.
___



[Examples]

___
limitNumber(5, 1, 10) ➞ 5

limitNumber(-3, 1, 10) ➞ 1

limitNumber(14, 1, 10) ➞ 10

limitNumber(4.6, 1, 10) ➞ 4.6
_____



[Notes]

___
*) All test inputs will be valid numbers.
*) All test inputs' range parameters will be in the correct order (i.e. the lower range will be less than or equal to the upper range).
___
