####  Return the Remainder from Two Numbers  ####

There is a single operator in C++, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. Return that value.


[Examples]

___
remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1

remainder(3, 4) ➞ 3

remainder(-9, 45) ➞ -9

remainder(5, 5) ➞ 0

[Notes]

___
*) The tests only use positive and negative integers.
*) Don't forget to return the result.
*) If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab.
*) If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab.
