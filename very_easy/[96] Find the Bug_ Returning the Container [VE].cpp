####  Find the Bug: Returning the Container  ####

The packaging system is running wild! The candy is lying loose all over in the warehouse, the cereal is missing, and bread is stuffed in a bottle. What is going on here? The candy should be in plastic and the bread should be in a bag.
The packaging machine is running the get_container() function to retrieve the container of a product. But something is not right...


[Examples]

___
get_container("Bread") ➞ "bag"

get_container("Beer") ➞ "bottle"

get_container("Candy") ➞ "plastic"

get_container("Cheese") ➞ "None"
_____

Think about what the object's packaging should be and check the syntax.
