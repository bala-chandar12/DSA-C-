####  Difference of Volumes of Cuboids  ####

Create a program that will take two arrays of integers, a and b. Each array will consist of 3 positive integers, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. Find the difference of the cuboids' volumes.
For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.


[Examples]

___
findDifference([ 28, 16, 29 ], [ 7, 8, 17 ]) ➞ 12040

findDifference([ 9, 22, 18 ], [ 16, 24, 10 ]) ➞ 276

findDifference([ 1, 9, 25 ], [ 10, 7, 9 ]) ➞ 405

findDifference([ 7, 6, 16 ], [ 26, 9, 26 ]) ➞ 5412
_____



[Notes]

Each array element is greater than 0.
