####  Caesar's Cipher  ####

Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it using a cipher. Caesar's cipher (check Resources tab for more info) shifts each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c.
Create a function that takes a string s (text to be encrypted) and an integer k (the rotation factor). It should return an encrypted string.


[Examples]

___
caesarCipher("middle-Outz", 2) ➞ "okffng-Qwvb"

// m -> o
// i -> k
// d -> f
// d -> f
// l -> n
// e -> g
// -    -
// O -> Q
// u -> w
// t -> v
// z -> b

caesarCipher("Always-Look-on-the-Bright-Side-of-Life", 5)
➞ "Fqbfdx-Qttp-ts-ymj-Gwnlmy-Xnij-tk-Qnkj"

caesarCipher("A friend in need is a friend indeed", 20)
➞ "U zlcyhx ch hyyx cm u zlcyhx chxyyx"
