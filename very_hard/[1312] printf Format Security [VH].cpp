####  printf Format Security  ####

printf is a standard C function that's a great way to easily print data to the console using format specifiers. That being said, it's common knowledge that you should NEVER give a user the ability to directly set the first parameter of a function that can take format specifiers.
To pass this challenge, you need to find out why users shouldn't be given full control of printf. A vulnerable function will take a string you provide and pass it to printf along with a value you need to modify.

[Notes]

A format specifier is a character set like %s or %f. Look for one that writes to memory.
