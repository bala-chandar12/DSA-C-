####  Coins Combinations  ####

Given an amount of money and an array of coins denominations, create a function that counts how many different ways you can make change with the given money.


[Examples]

___
coinsCombinations(4, [1, 2]) ➞ 3
// 1+1+1+1 = 4
// 1+1+2 = 4
// 2+2 = 4

coinsCombinations(10, [5, 2, 3]) ➞ 4

coinsCombinations(11, [5, 7]) ➞ 0
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Order of coins does not matter (i.e. 1+1+2 == 2+1+1).
*) You have an infinite amount of coins.

When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop.
