####  Minimum Steps to a Palindrome  ####

Given an incomplete palindrome as a string, return the minimum letters needed to be added on to the end to make the string a palindrome.


[Examples]

___
minPalindromeSteps("race") ➞ 3
// Add 3 letters: "car" to make "racecar"

minPalindromeSteps("mada") ➞ 1
// Add 1 letter: "m" to make "madam"

// Add 3 letters: "rim" to make "mirrorrim"
