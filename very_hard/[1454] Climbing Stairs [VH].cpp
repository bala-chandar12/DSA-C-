####  Climbing Stairs  ####

A staircase is given with a non-negative cost per each step. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. Create a solution to find the minimum sum of costs to reach the top (finishing the payments including cost[-2] or cost[-1]). You can either start at cost[0] or cost[1].
